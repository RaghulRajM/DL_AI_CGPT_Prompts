# DL_AI_CGPT_Prompts

This repository was created using the contents from Deeplearning.ai's courses.

Intro:
There are two types of LLMS-
Base LLMs - That predict the next word. For eg, If asked what's the capital of France?, It predicts Which is the largest city in France?....

Instruction Tuned LLMs - Tries to follow instructions. Gives Paris as the answer when that question is asked. It uses Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback. The course will focus on this type. 

Guidelines:
* **Instructions need to be clear and specific** : Make use of delimiters (""", ```, ---) to distinguish between the instructions and the content to be used.
  * Delimiters help in preventing prompt injections (Some part of the content that's conflicting with the instruction). 
  * Sub-nested bullet etc

* **Give the model sometime to think** :
